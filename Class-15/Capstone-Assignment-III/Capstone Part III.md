For testing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model with `promptfoo`, various types of metrics can assess the model's performance in retrieving and generating accurate, concise, and useful information. Here are some examples, using concepts from the previous IRS documents.

### 1. **Inclusion Metrics** (`icontains` and `notcontains`)
   - **Purpose**: Checks if specific keywords or phrases appear in the output, which are expected based on the question and document content.
   - **Examples**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: How do I report OID income on my tax return?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "Form 1099-OID"
       - vars:
           topic: Is there a penalty if I don’t provide an EIN?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "penalty"
     ```

### 2. **Conciseness Metric**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the generated answer is concise and does not contain unnecessary information.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: What should I do if I didn’t receive a Form 1099-OID?
         assert:
           - type: javascript
             value: 1 / (output.length + 1)
           # penalizes longer outputs
     ```

### 3. **Presence of Key Terms** (`llm-rubric`)
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates whether the answer includes specific terms or phrases required for a complete answer.
   - **Examples**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: What are the rules for backup withholding on debt instruments?
         assert:
           - type: llm-rubric
             value: ensure the answer includes rules for backup withholding and OID income reporting
       - vars:
           topic: How do I electronically file my employment tax return?
         assert:
           - type: llm-rubric
             value: check that the output mentions 'e-file', 'EIN', and 'employment tax return' as applicable
     ```

### 4. **Correctness of Numerical Values**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies if the output includes the correct numerical values, percentages, or calculations.
   - **Examples**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: What percentage is required for backup withholding on OID?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "24%"
       - vars:
           topic: What is the de minimis threshold for OID?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "0.0025"
     ```

### 5. **Relevance Score** (`javascript` with relevance scoring logic)
   - **Purpose**: Assigns a higher relevance score to outputs that contain required keywords and are shorter, indicating relevance and conciseness.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: Where can I find information on e-filing Forms W-2?
         assert:
           - type: javascript
             value: "output.includes('SSA.gov') && output.length < 200 ? 1 : 0"
     ```

### 6. **Answer Completeness** (`llm-rubric`)
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the response thoroughly covers expected subtopics or details relevant to the question.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: How can brokers use the OID tables for reporting?
         assert:
           - type: llm-rubric
             value: check that the answer discusses both the purpose of OID tables and how brokers apply them for reporting
     ```

### 7. **Validation of Specific Formats or References**
   - **Purpose**: Checks if specific formats (such as document references, URLs, or section headers) are correctly included in the output.
   - **Examples**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: Where can I access the OID tables?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "IRS.gov/Pub1212"

       - vars:
           topic: Is backup withholding applied outside the U.S.?
         assert:
           - type: icontains
             value: "Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)"
     ```

### 8. **Comparative Metric on Output Length for Similar Queries**
   - **Purpose**: Tests if responses to related queries vary appropriately in length based on the complexity of the topic.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: Do I need to provide my EIN when e-filing?
         assert:
           - type: javascript
             value: "output.length < 100 ? 1 : 0"

       - vars:
           topic: Explain the rules for OID reporting on tax returns.
         assert:
           - type: javascript
             value: "output.length > 200 ? 1 : 0"
     ```

### 9. **Logical Consistency Metric**
   - **Purpose**: Validates that the response aligns logically with the topic's requirements, such as providing proper steps or sequence.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     tests:
       - vars:
           topic: What steps should I take if I need an installment agreement for my taxes?
         assert:
           - type: llm-rubric
             value: check that the response logically outlines the steps to apply for an installment agreement
     ```

These metrics allow for a diverse and thorough assessment of the RAG model’s accuracy, relevance, and completeness in responses based on IRS document content.
